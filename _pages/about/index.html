My name is Denini, I’m 23 years old and passionate about computing, more specifically to programming languages and software test. In 2020, I decided to embark in the research area. Between 2020 and the beginning of 2022 I did my master’s degree, as soon as I finished my master’s I started to a PhD (first in the selection process).</p> <p>I’m currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil). Advised by <a href="https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Marcelo d’Amorim</a>. I’m interested in software engineering, programming language, testing and software development.</p> <p>My current research is in the area of software testing, focusing on the Android environment. But I’ve participated in projects on test parallelism, automated error repair and code instrumentation.</p> </body></html>
