Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE – Brazil), advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo d’Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/). I'm 27 years old and passionate about computing, particularly software engineering.

I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2022, and since then I have been pursuing my Ph.D. with a focus on software testing, especially in the Android ecosystem. I have been actively involved in academic research since 2020.

Soon, I will also be serving as an Assistant Professor at the University of Pernambuco (UPE).

My research interests include:

- Software Engineering
- Programming Languages
- Software Testing
- Software Development
