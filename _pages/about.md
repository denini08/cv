Hi! My name is Denini, I’m 23 years old and passionate about computing, more specifically to programming languages and software test. In 2020, I decided to embark in the research area. Between 2020 and the beginning of 2022 I did my master’s degree, as soon as I finished my master’s I started to a PhD (first in the selection process).

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil). Advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo d’Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/). I'm interested in software engineering, programming language, testing and software development. I'm researching in the software testing area, focused on the Android environment.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
