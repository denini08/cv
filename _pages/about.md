Hi! My name is Denini, I’m 23 years old and passionate about computing, more specifically to programming languages and software test. In 2020, I decided to embark in the research area. Between 2020 and the beginning of 2022 I did my master’s degree, as soon as I finished my master’s I started to a PhD (first in the selection process).

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil). Advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo d’Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/). I'm interested in software engineering, programming language, testing and software development. 

My current research is in the area of software testing, focusing on the Android environment. But I've participated in projects on test parallelism, automated error repair and code instrumentation.
