I have officially defended my master’s dissertation and can now say I’m a Master in Computer Science! 🎓

The title of my dissertation was _“Using Noise to Detect Test Flakiness”_. I am deeply grateful to my supervisor and co-supervisor for their guidance and support, as well as to the evaluation committee for their valuable feedback throughout this process.
