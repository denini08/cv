Another important step completed in my PhD journey: I successfully passed the **qualification exam**! ðŸŽ“

I was approved in my PhD qualification exam at CIn-UFPE. My research is focused on **flaky tests**â€”tests that produce inconsistent results without changes to the codeâ€”an issue that greatly impacts software reliability and developer productivity.  

Passing this stage marks an important milestone, confirming that my research path is well structured and giving me the opportunity to move forward with confidence toward the final defense.
