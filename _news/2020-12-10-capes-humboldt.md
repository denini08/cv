I was awarded a [CAPES Humboldt Research Fellowship](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/publicados-nomes-de-pesquisadores-que-vao-a-alemanha) to work with [Sven Apel](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/apel/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) on *Analysis of Variability over Time and Space*, tentatively starting on October'21 (depending on the pandemic).
