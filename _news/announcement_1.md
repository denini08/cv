great news: I was approved in the PhD selection at CIn-UFPE in first place.

Today I received news that made me very happy, I was approved in first place in the selection of PhD students in the graduate program in computer science at CIn-UFPE. This is the result of the great work I had with my supervisor during my master's degree, which is now bearing fruit for the phd.

The title of the approved pre-project was "Finding Bugs using Natural Language Processing" but this journey will probably not be limited to this theme alone.
