Great news: I have been approved in first place in the PhD selection process at CIn-UFPE! 🎉

Today I received news that made me very happy: I was accepted, in first place, into the PhD program in Computer Science at CIn-UFPE. This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication throughout my master’s degree, developed under the guidance of my supervisor, and it is very rewarding to see these efforts bearing fruit.

My approved research proposal was titled _“Finding Bugs Using Natural Language Processing”_, but this PhD journey will certainly explore broader themes and new directions along the way.
